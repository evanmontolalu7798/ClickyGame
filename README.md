# ClickyGame (Android and Windows)
ClickyGame, a click game (inspired by cookie clicker, just sucks) for Android and Windows.

This is my first game, I just did this for my friend, but wanting to let ya (my viewers) feel like what this game could be, so I did the unthinkable — posted it public (not on Play Store and Microsoft Store)

# Requirements
## Android
alpha1 and alpha1.1 only supports arm64-v8

v1.0.0beta will support only armeabi-v7a, even though it's gonna decrease game performance, but it's just a 2d game, what could go wrong ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯

## Windows
My plan is to have v1.0.0beta is to have x86 only (the exe installed file) and supports Windows 7+ (or maybe just Windows 10+).

Also the answer is the same as Android (armeabi-v7a is x86 if Windows)
